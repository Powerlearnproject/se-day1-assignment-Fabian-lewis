Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methodologies and tools to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of quality software systems. 

Software Engineering is important in the technology industry because:
1. It enables the creation of software applications that are reliable, efficient and maintainable. Software engineering practices such as testing allows developers and software engineers to ensure software works correcty as expected. Practices such as algorithm optimization, code review and database optimization allow creation of efficient software applications. 
2. It reduces development costs and time by use of structured processes. Software Development Life Cycle is a software engineering pratice that divides the development process into clear phases ensuring smooth progress.
3. It helps in large scale project management. Software engineering methodologies such as Scrum and pratices such as Version Control allow teams to collaborate and work efficiently which helps manage large projects.
4. It helps improve user satisfaction and user experience while using the software application. Practices such as prototyping allow software engineers to ensure software applications are user centered, easy to use and accessible.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming Languages. Before the introduction of high level programming languages software was written in machine code (binary digits). The introduction of high level languages such as Fortran in 1957, COBOL in 1959 and LISP in 1958 made software development more accessible and faster. It also allowed programs to be portable across different hardware.
2. The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline. In 1968 the NATO conference in Germany introduced software engineering as a discipline to help address software projects that were failing due to poor planning, lack of structure and rising complexity. The conference encouraged the use of modular programming to improve maintainability, established formal software deveopment methodologies and facilitated the introduction of Structured programming.
3. The rise of Agile Methodologies. In 2001 Agile Manifesto and DevOps were adopted. This was done to address the slow and rigid nature of tradional methods such as waterfall methodology. The agile manifesto introduced a flexible and iterative development with techniques such as Scrum that allow software delivery in small frequent updates. Agile methodologies allowed fast software releases, improved collaboration between developers and allows automated testing, deployment and monitoring.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
