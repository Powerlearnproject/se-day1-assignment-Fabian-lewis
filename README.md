#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methodologies and tools to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of quality software systems. 

Software Engineering is important in the technology industry because:
1. It enables the creation of software applications that are reliable, efficient and maintainable. Software engineering practices such as testing allows developers and software engineers to ensure software works correcty as expected. Practices such as algorithm optimization, code review and database optimization allow creation of efficient software applications. 
2. It reduces development costs and time by use of structured processes. Software Development Life Cycle is a software engineering pratice that divides the development process into clear phases ensuring smooth progress.
3. It helps in large scale project management. Software engineering methodologies such as Scrum and pratices such as Version Control allow teams to collaborate and work efficiently which helps manage large projects.
4. It helps improve user satisfaction and user experience while using the software application. Practices such as prototyping allow software engineers to ensure software applications are user centered, easy to use and accessible.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming Languages. Before the introduction of high level programming languages software was written in machine code (binary digits). The introduction of high level languages such as Fortran in 1957, COBOL in 1959 and LISP in 1958 made software development more accessible and faster. It also allowed programs to be portable across different hardware.
2. The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline. In 1968 the NATO conference in Germany introduced software engineering as a discipline to help address software projects that were failing due to poor planning, lack of structure and rising complexity. The conference encouraged the use of modular programming to improve maintainability, established formal software deveopment methodologies and facilitated the introduction of Structured programming.
3. The rise of Agile Methodologies. In 2001 Agile Manifesto and DevOps were adopted. This was done to address the slow and rigid nature of tradional methods such as waterfall methodology. The agile manifesto introduced a flexible and iterative development with techniques such as Scrum that allow software delivery in small frequent updates. Agile methodologies allowed fast software releases, improved collaboration between developers and allows automated testing, deployment and monitoring.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Gathering. This is the first phase of the cycle. It involves gathering data, on user and systems needs and documenting it.
2. Design. This is the second phase of the SDLC where the system architecture is planned. It invoves making decisions and creating detailed designs on the database, user interfaces and the system flow.
3. Implementation. This is where the actual developing happens. In this stage developers write code that turn the designs into a real system.
4. Testing. In this stage the software is evaluated to ensure it meets the standard quality and the functional requirements.
5. Deployment. In this stage the software solution is released to the users or customers for use.
6. Maintenance. In this stage, a deployed software is monitored to ensure it works well, meets changing needs and is secure. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear development approach where each phase is completed bofore moving on to the next. The phases flow downwards like a waterfall. Agile methodology on the other hand is an iterative development approach where a project is divided into small sprints (development cycles that may last from 2 to 4 weeks) with each sprint delivering a working version of the software. 
Waterfall methodology is rigid making it difficult to make changes while agile methodology offers more flexibiity that allows adaptation and accomodate changes.
Waterfall methodology requires longer development time before the sotware product is released while Agile methodology allows developers to work faster releasing a working version of the software product in each iteration. 
Waterfall methodology is suitable for large and well defined projects where needs and requirements are static while agile methodology is suitable for projects where user needs and requirements are dynamic and not clearly defined. 
For example government projects that are well defined and require clear documentation may be implemented using waterfall methodology but when developing a game agile methodology may be used. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer. This person is responsible for designing, writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer. This person ensures that a sofware product or solution meets the quality standard by testing for bugs, security flaws and performance issues.
3. Project Manager. This person oversees the software development process and ensures that sofware products are delivered within the set budget and deadlines. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Intergrated Development Environments - These are software applications that provide a complete set of tools for writing code, debugging and testing it. Exampes of such softwares include Visual Studio, Intellij IDEA and Eclipse
2. Version Control Systems. These are systems that help developers track and manage changes to code over time. They allow deveopers to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other's work. Examples include GIT and subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers
1. Changing requirements. User and/or system requirements may change during the software development cycle which leads to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight deadlines. Software quality may be compromised when developers have pressure to deliver software solutions on a schedule.
3. Technical debt. This is a shortcut to development that employs quick fixes to coding which are faster in short term but may create problems in the long term especially during maintenance.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing. This test is done on individual components (units) to make sure thet work correctly. It helps catching errors early before they spread to other parts of the system.
2. Intergration Testing. This is a test done to evaluate how different modules work together. It ensures smooth data flow and communication between different parts of the system.
3. System Testing. This is a test done on the entire system as a whole. The purpose is to ensure that the entire system works correctly as a single unit.
4. Acceptance Testing. This is a test done on the system to ensure that it meets user needs and expectations. It is done by the users of the system.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Statement
"Tell me about Software engineering"
Improved Statement
"Explain what software engineering and give examples on some of the tools and methodologies used by software developers"

The improved statement is better because it clearly highlights the specific issue that needs to be addressed. It uses concise wording to guide the AI model on what exactly is expected.
